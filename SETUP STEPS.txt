NEXT STEP
   build a new project from scratch
   repeat steps to get it working
   verify that tsc is working along the way



PROBLEM # 1
   tsc fails with lots of error messages

PROBLEM # 2
   launch.json fails on mmini because it says cannot find yarn - though this works on mac studio




path to yarn is /Users/chrissuchar/.nvm/versions/node/v23.11.0/bin/yarn  on mac studio


tsc produces renderer.jsx - don't i want just a js ?
    how does it work in viewer etc.?
